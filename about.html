            <h1>Hi! I'm Lydia</h1>
            <p>I am a student from Republic Polytechnic, 
            studying under the Diploma in Digital Design & Development.
            </p>           
            <p>Often described as optimistic, 
            I strive to work towards my goals despite the circumstances. 
            I am always seeking for improvements to challenge myself 
            to build my skills and character.

            <h1>What Do I Do?</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am learning to develop as well as design 
                apps and websites. Traversing through this unfamiliar 
                industry is daunting, but also exciting. I learn to code - 
                something I never thought I could do, and find that 
                it's not that bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of that, I am a creative individual who spends 
                their spare time making illustrations and trying out 
                other forms of art such as watercolour painting and 
                crocheting. I also help run the school's art club, 
                further showing my passion in the arts.
            </p>

    <div class="text">
        <h1>What Do I Want?</h1>
        <p>I want to explore where this path will take me. 
            I didn't expect to understand what was taught and 
            I wish to learn more and expand my skills with this.
