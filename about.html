                <h2>hi! i'm lydia</h2>
                <p>I am a student from Republic Polytechnic, 
                studying under the Diploma in Digital Design & Development.
                </p>           
                <p>Often described as optimistic, 
                I strive to work towards my goals despite the circumstances. 
                I am always seeking for improvements to challenge myself 
                to build my skills and character.

                <h2>what do i do?</h2>
                <p>Currently, I am learning to develop as well as design 
                    apps and websites. Traversing through this unfamiliar 
                    industry is daunting, but also exciting. I learn to code - 
                    something I never thought I could do, and find that 
                    it's not that bad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of that, I am a creative individual who spends 
                    their spare time making illustrations and trying out 
                    other forms of art such as watercolour painting and 
                    crocheting. I also help run the school's art club, 
                    further showing my passion in the arts.

            <p>I want to explore where this path will take me. 
                I didn't expect to understand what was taught and 
                I wish to learn more and expand my skills with this.
