            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>Using the Adobe software,<br>
                we needed to make a business card for ourselves</p>    
        </div>
        <div class="para"> 
            <h2>process</h2>
            <img class="pd" src="images\des_bizcard_sketch.png" width="40%"/>
            <p>I had created a logo prior to this project<br>
                and thought that it was suitable. So what I ended up doing is<br>
                make a business card that is based on the logo's design</p>
            <p>As seen by the concept sketches<br>
                I was playing around with the logo's positions around the card<br>
                as well as the text placement.<br>
                I personally like the part where the tip of the castle<br>
                is appearing at the bottom of the card and thought that<br>
                it seemed suitable as the "cover"</p>

            <h2>takeaways</h2>
            <p>From this assignment,<br>
                I was able to practice experimenting the different layouts<br>
                and learnt that this is why we should do concept sketching.</p>
