            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, I created a simpel To Do List app in Adobe XD as a personal practice to 
                understand how to use the prototype features such as auto-animate</p>    
        </div>
        
        <h2>process</h2>
        <img class="pd" src="images\To Do List LoFi.png" width="55%"/>
            <div class="para"> 
                <p>I began with comparing two popular to do list apps: Google Tasks and To Do List. 
                    I found that Google Tasks has a minimalistic style, and as features that make it 
                    an efficient to do list app like its 'Set Repeated Tasks'. However, you do not get 
                    an overview of all of the tasks, making some tasks 'hidden'.</p>
                <p>As for the other app, the calendar view provides a good oppotunity to see what tasks 
                    are there for today. However, they hide the sub-tasks which would require the user 
                    to click more in order to see the sub-tasks, which isn't very efficient.</p>
                <p>My goal with this app was to allow the user to see everything without anything hiding. 
                    Additionally, I wanted the app to feature an in-built timer with pre-set timings. I 
                    also wanted to add reminder system that both aforementioned apps had.</p>
                <p>As for design, I decided to lean towards a simplistic style so that it does not confuse 
                    the user. There are also subtle cues like the navigation bar highlighting what page they 
                    are on that I think serves as a benefit.</p>

                <h2>takeaways</h2>
                <p>Overall, I managed to practice with the prototype features that Adobe XD has to offer. 
                    While creating this, I attempted to think in the perspective of a first-time user as well 
                    as a mobile user.</p>
