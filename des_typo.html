            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, we were to create a set of alphabet with a unique style using Adobe 
                Illustrator. The design is completely up to our imagination's desire.</p>

            <p>At the time of the assignment, I was a big fan of the Thirteenth Doctor from the Doctor 
                Who series. So I decided to create this set of alphabets based on her.</p>
            <p>The character has a fun, bright personality. She's from space and often travels through 
                it during every adventure. Additionally, the clothes she wears is quite retro.</p>
            <p>Combining all those traits together, we get a retro-styled fonts (often features curved 
                or exaggerated serifs) in blue and yellow, and stars here and there to show that she's not human.</p>

            <h2>takeaways</h2>
            <p>From this assignment, I get the opportunity to explore the world of typography to create my very own.</p>    
            <p>A challenge that I did face, however, was ensuring that every letter look consistent. 
                It was tough to figure out how each letter would look in this style. But the solution to 
                that was to keep on experimenting.
