            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>DFor this project, we had to make a poster for a cultural exhibition with the design concepts that we have learnt thus far</p>       
        </div>
        <div class="para"> 
            <h2>process</h2>
            <p>I found that my strengths lie in Adobe Illustrator, so I decided to draw elements that represents that Chinese culture
                such as the lanterns, the dragon and the temple. I used red and gold due to its prosperous meanings tied to those colours, and used
                neutral colours like white or grey so as to not clash with the two main colours.
            </p>
            <p>Originally, I wanted to use various different colours for the illustration but found that it looked overwhelming. But upon using
                minimal colours, I was able to overcome that challenge and create what I did.
            </p>
            <p>In this assignment, I applied symmetry as seen by the illustration. I took into account the time was given and opted for something
                simple but effective.

            <h2>takeaways</h2>
            <p>From this, I was able to practice using Adobe Illustrator to create illustrations and take into account the colours that I use.</p>
