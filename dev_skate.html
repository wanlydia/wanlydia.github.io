            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>During my HTML lesson, we were introduced to a CSS Framework called Bootstrap</p>
            <p>We were to apply it to make a supermarket website with three products from two different categories.</p>           
        </div>
        <div class="para"> 
            <h2>process</h2>
            <p>I didn't think I would end up with a pretty product so I creatively came up with 'Subpar-Market'.</p>
            <p>In this assignment, I had to create a navigation bar with a dropdown for product categories as well as
                creating cards and a pop-up upon clicking it.
            </p>      
        </div>
        <div class="para"> 
            <h2>takeaways</h2>
            <p>We can see that there are some amendments that I could make towards the website.</p>
            <p>For example, the images of the product could be of the same size. This would create a uniform rows of cards.
                Additionally, maybe I could make the cards smaller so that they're not overwhelming the viewer.
