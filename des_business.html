            <p>This is the first time we used Adobe XD. So as practice, our teacher told us to create a 
                business website. I decided to fulfil my idea of a book cafe where there is an art class upstairs.</p>

            <p>I began the process with a moodboard to encapsulate the mood I was aiming for - and that was 
                cosiness. I chose brown as the main colour as it often means 'down-to-earth' or 'stability'. 
                Plus the fact that it is a cafe, brown seemed the right colour to choose. The brown is contrasted 
                with a light beige. I chose a serif font for this website as it looked professional but in the 
                victorian era manner.</p>
