            <h2>overview</h2>
            <p>In this project, we had to create a poster for a cultural exhibition 
                about the Chinese citizens, using either Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. 
                In this case, I opted for Illustrator as that was the software I was best at using.</p>

        <div class="para">     
            <p>As the poster was about the Chinese Singaporeans, I wanted to display elements 
                of their culture. In the moodboard, we can see images of delicious Chines cuisines, 
                Chinese temples, lanterns and dragons. I also decided to use red and gold as they 
                are colours strong linked to the Chinese.</p>
            <p>In my sketches, I wanted to include an illustration as a means to capture the 
                audience's attention. It would also immediately tell them what the poster is about. 
                I had to consider the time I was given, so I stuck with a simple poster.</p>
            <p>Originally, the dragon in the poster was coloured in. But I soon find out that it made 
                the poster overwhelming as it fights for attention against the temple. So I instead 
                opted to give it a gold outline design instead.</p>

            <h2>takeaways</h2>
            <p>From this assignment, I learnt the importance of colours and how it can make or 
                break the design.</p>
